Introduction

We have designed a Database for Domestic Aviaton System. It is an Airline Ticketing System which is designed for eight airlines with almost 40 routes.

The Software package comprises an sql file which contains the create table statements and commands for inserting the data to tables. There are 
8 csv files one each for every table which contains the values to be inserted into tables. There are 12 files(select_sql) with one select query in each file.
The package also contains a README.txt containing instructions for executing the queries.
